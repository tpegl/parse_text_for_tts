Apples are one of the most widely cultivated and consumed fruits in the world. Known for their crisp texture, sweet-tart flavor, and impressive versatility,
apples have a long and fascinating history that spans cultures, continents, and centuries. Botanically classified as Malus domestica, apples belong to the Rosaceae family, which also includes pears, cherries, and roses.

The domestic apple traces its ancestry to the wild apple species Malus sieversii, native to the mountains of Central Asia—particularly in what is now Kazakhstan. Ancient traders along the Silk Road helped spread apples westward to Europe and eastward to China. Over time, through both natural cross-pollination and human intervention, the apple evolved into the diverse array of cultivars we enjoy today.

Apples were highly prized by ancient civilizations. The Greeks and Romans cultivated them extensively, and they became symbolic in many myths and traditions. In Norse mythology, apples were believed to grant eternal youth. In the biblical tradition, the apple became associated—though possibly inaccurately—with the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.
